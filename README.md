Define your main language format that serve to be the reference or the model

const translation = {
    hello: "Hello !"
} as const satifies TranslateStructure;

//Define the model for other lang
export type Model = TranslationModel<typeof translation>;

export default translation;
```

Next you can use it to your main file

```ts
//main.ts
import type { initTranslate } from "@qtranslate/mod.ts";
import EN from "./en.ts"

const { t } = initTranslate(EN);

console.log(t('hello')); //Hello !
```

```ts

export default {
    hello: "Bonjour !"
} satisfies Model;
```

With this syntax you can ensure your other translation to follow the same structure than your reference language, here en.ts
